        HTML is the language in which most websites are written.<br>
        HTML is used to create pages and make them functional.<br>
        HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.<br>
        Hypertext means that the document contains links that
        allow the reader to jump to other places in the document
        or to another document altogether.<br>
        A Markup Language is a way that computers speak to each
        other to control how text is processed and presented. <br>
        To do this HTML uses two things: tags and attributes.
